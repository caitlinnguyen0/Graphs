**Graph class**
The Graph class creates an instance of an empty graph with 0 vertices and 0 edges. 

**generateConnectedGraph()**
Running the generateConnectedGraph() function randomly generates a graph with a minimum of 3 vertices and 2 edges, effectively storing that information in the Graph object.
